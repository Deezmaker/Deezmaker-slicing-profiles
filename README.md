Slicing profiles for the Bukobot and Bukito 3D printers

These profiles use firmware retraction by default, and are intended for use with Bukobot firmware from https://github.com/whosawhatsis/Marlin. If the "Last Updated" date that you see when connecting to your machine is before 2014-04-27, you should update it to work with these profiles.
